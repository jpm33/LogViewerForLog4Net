OD MARCH 2011
This file has been added to the solution to allow each person working on this project to add notes.
You can add entries following the same model of this one. Not perfect but can be important.

Today I cleaned up a bit the code.
private member must follow camel casing. Public ones PascalCasing.
Some .ToString() and others of this kind are often useless, I suppressed them.
File header as been normalized, all the same now.
Each file has a History region. It will a good idea each person will add what it did on the file here.

Project bin / obj folder has been marked as ignored on my side, try to set the same on your side.
Theses folders are big and without any interest at this time. Later we will produce a binary release.

OD June 2012
Modifying topbar layout : when a lot of files where opened, file names were overwritting the filter symbol.
I also changed the order of message priority filter, current order has no meaning. Now, first is Error, second is Warning, etc. A more logical order.
I also modified the layout of the "Path" area in the topbar so now very long path (or multiple file names when many files are merged) are gently trimmed with CharacterEllipsis.
The "FilterIndicator" (that can be clicked to clear current filtering) has now a transparent background so user can click it more easily (not only on the stroke of the drawing).
Version is now 2.7.2.0
